# Machine-Learning
============
General grab-bag repository of Machine Learning tools, utilities, workflows, and benchmarks.  This is a general collection of software I have accumulated over the course of my work and research, and I have made it available to the community for feedback and learning purposes.

## How To Get Started

- [Download the Code](https://github.com/camilo-v/Machine-Learning) and follow the standard instructions on how to install the framework/library.

## Communication

- If you **found a bug**, open an issue and _please provide detailed steps to reliably reproduce it_.
- If you have **feature request**, open an issue.
- If you **would like to contribute**, please submit a pull request.

## Requirements

The basic requirements for the software are:

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [ggplot](http://ggplot2.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

You will also need a reasonably modern computer and operating system that can support the above.

### R

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is required for running some of the scripts. A lot of the classifiers are available in other libraries and platforms such as [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/), but I used [R](https://www.r-project.org/) so that I could get a good idea of how a given algorithm works.

### CRAN

[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) is required to support [R](https://www.r-project.org/) as most of the classifiers are not available in a default plain-vannilla [R](https://www.r-project.org/) installation.

### GGPLOT

[ggplot](http://ggplot2.org/) is used to plot results, but also to make them look good! :)

### Python

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is great, but I wanted to learn [Python](https://www.python.org/) a little better, so in some cases I chose to go with [Python](https://www.python.org/) just because it could teach me something new.
